title: "SMART-MRP"
---

This website contains details and readings on our proposal, ***SMART-MRP: Simulating place-based outcomes from behavioural datasets***. 

The proposal is motivated by some existing (and ongoing) work on inserting MRP into GIScience: Our 2025 GISRUK abstract, [Should we use Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification when
simulating area-level population outcomes?](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/id/eprint/226795/1/mrp_gisruk.pdf), and [associated talk](https://www.roger-beecham.com/slides/mrp/slides.html#/title-slide).
